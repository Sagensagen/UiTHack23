# Meeting 06. September

## Date
Host the event in the middle of February, hopefully a Saturday and tentative 11. or 18. Thus due to all students are back to campus by then, people has got into routine and most assignments has been given by then. Also to host in this time of the year the freshman students are not too newbies ;)

## Theme
Theme is an ongoing vote, and is set by 9. September.
