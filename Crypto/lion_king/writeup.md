## Writeup
The flag is encoded using base64 (recognized by the '==' at the end).

It can be decoded in the (unix) terminal
```bash
$Â echo VWlUSGFjazIze0g0a3VuNF9tNDdhdDQhfQ== | base64 -d
UiTHack23{H4kun4_m47at4!}
```
or using an online decoder (e.g. [Cyberchef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/))

```
UiTHack23{H4kun4_m47at4!}
```
