# Lost My Keys
> Crypto - 350 pts

There I was, making a CTF challenge, and out of nowhere lost the file containing the flag!
Without any fault of mine, the wrong script got executed; `python loseKeys.py my-keys jungle`.
All of a sudden there's a figurative jungle of a dictionary staring me down like an angry tiger.

Who so ever put that script on my computer should get a good ol' spanking, but I don't really know what to do now.
All I've got is this file with [song lyrics](src/jungle) and a [binary file](src/jungle-of-keys.bin) with my catastrophy inside.

Can you helps?
