# Crypto - Translation

> Crypto - 150pts

I fired up my old machine, the whirling and clicking of the hard drive was comforting. I opened up the terminal and typed in the command to run the program. There I was greeted with a weird [text](./text), but im no Klingon. Can you help me translate it?

Tips: You may find some decoders online
