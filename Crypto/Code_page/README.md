# Crypto - Code Page

> Crypto - 100pts

I fired up my old machine, the whirling and clicking of the hard drive was comforting. I opened up the terminal and typed in the passcode: 2 1 0 2 7 and was greeted with the homescreen. There I found with a weird [text](./file1), but im no Klingon. Can you help me translate it?

Tips: There was another [file](file2) in the directory, maybe it can help you?
