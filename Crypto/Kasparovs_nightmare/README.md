# Crypto - Kasparov's Nightmare

> Crypto - 250

Kasparov is sick and tired of overused cryptographic techniques and has decided to invent his own technique using a simple chess puzzle. A chess board is a 8x8 square represented by letters going from left to right and numbers up and down. Force the checkmate as white. 


Tips: There are three potential checkmates, all are forced but only one of them has the correct sequence that Kasparov is looking for!
