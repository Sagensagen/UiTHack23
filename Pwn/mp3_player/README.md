# Pwn - Mp3 Player
> Pwn - 150pts

We found an old mp3 player laying around and decided to connect it to the internet for everyone to listen to its good ol' hits. <br />
However, we might have messed up some of the instructions when setting it up...

You can connect to the mp3 player with
```bash
$ nc wwww.limewire.td.org.uit.no 6100
```

Hint 1. Maybe there is a way to call the function printing the flag

Hint 2. Ever heard of a buffer overflow?
