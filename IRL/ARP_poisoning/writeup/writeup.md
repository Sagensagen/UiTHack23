## Writeup
Connect to a the LAN established and do a MITM attack by ARP poisoning and sniff the traffic from the few ip's
sending data on the network.
Multiple attenders at the network will might result in sniffing each others rather than the actual flag, and overflow the arp table multiple times flushing other mitm attacks.
