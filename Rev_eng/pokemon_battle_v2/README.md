# Rev - Pokemon Battle V2
> Rev - 500 pts

The feedback for the V1 of the Pokemon Battle has been reviewed, and the following changes have been made:
- Gym leaders have less hp
- The amount of gym leaders have been reduced from 5 to 3
- Patched unintended way to view the flag
- The game encrypts the flag for you when you beat the game

Here is your patched version of the [game](src/pokemon_v2).

Hint 1. I have given the code more armor <br>
Hint 2. I wish the code didn't encrypt the flag after I beat the game
