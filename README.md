# UiTHack23
Repository for the yearly CTF challenge by UiT students

### Motivation and vision

> We want to create more interest and enthusiasm for security and related problems for students. For this, a noob-friendly Capture-the-flag competition is perfect! The idea is to expose people to gradually more challenging tasks, starting with very simple ones and moving to more complex ones. None should be too hard and some help will be given for those in need.

This is a test for merging3
